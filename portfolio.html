            <p id="div_content">Greetings! I'm Akilesh, a dedicated student at the esteemed National Institute of Technology,
                Tiruchirapalli. My enthusiasm for learning drives me to traverse the vast landscape of the software
                industry's diverse domains. I possess a proficient command over Web Development technologies,
                encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. Furthermore, I've embarked on a journey to
                delve into the realms of Data Structures and Algorithms, a pursuit I've recently undertaken. With the
                belief that once a student, always a student, I eagerly anticipate the prospect of embracing promising
                opportunities that lie ahead.

                Puzzle Game
            </p>
            <p id="desc"><b>Description:</b> This project presents an engaging puzzle game that allows users to select an image from their personal computer. Once chosen, the image undergoes a shuffling process, disarranging its tiles. The challenge then lies in rearranging these tiles into their correct order and designated area. Upon successful completion of the puzzle, a gratifying window emerges, announcing the player's victory. Conversely, an unsuccessful attempt prompts a notification indicating the need for another try. This interactive game merges visual creativity with problem-solving, offering an enjoyable experience for users.

                File Sharer

            <p id="desc"><b>Description:</b>This platform serves as a secure File Sharer, enabling users to conveniently upload files for seamless transfer to others. Upon uploading a file, an exclusive link is generated, which can be fortified with an optional password for added security. When the intended recipient receives the link and attempts to access it, the browser prompts them for the designated password. If the password provided aligns with the one set by the sender, access to the file is granted; otherwise, entry is denied. This mechanism ensures a safeguarded and controlled sharing process, emphasizing confidentiality and user control.</p>
